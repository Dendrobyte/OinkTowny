**Describe the issue**
Think of Mark's personal **HELP** acronym when describing the issue.

**H**ow did the issue occur? What did you do at the time?
**E**veryone involved. Who was with me, or could help describe further details for staff?
**L**ocation? If I'm offline, where can staff members find the problem? Where were you when it happened?
**P**lease and thanks :) The devs are busy, and we love to see good manners

**To Reproduce**
Take this time to explain how to reproduce the issue. For example...
1. Get a bow
2. Enchant that bow
3. If the enchantment is a custom one, there is a blank line where lore should be added.

**Why is this wrong?**
Tell us why you think this is incorrect. For example, if you think a custom enchantment should show new lore on your item, that would be the _expected outcome._

**Screenshots**

**More context!**
If there's anything else that's relevant, please put it here.
